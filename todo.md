Essentials:
# Import 3D models
# Add Physic engine -> DONE
# Add Drag&Drop using Raycaster (It should be usefull to read the source code of ThreeDragControls.js, because that uses Raycaster too)

Minor Priority:
# Refactor ThreeDragControls JS --> Maybe it's not necessary anymore, because the logic is changed.

Project:
# Minify JS files
